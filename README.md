## Overview

Notes is a simple web application that has been developed using the Flask framework in Python. The app is designed to allow users to create, read, and delete notes on the website. 
It features user authentication and message flashing. This project marks the beginning of my full-stack web development journey :)

## Features

- **User Authentication:** User can sign up for an account, and log in/log out from that account.
- **Create, Read, and Delete Notes:** After logging in, users have the ability to create, view, and delete their own notes.
- **Message Flashing:** When certain actions are performed (e.g., successful note creation or deletion), a message is flashed to the user.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** The server-side language used for this project.
- **Flask:** A micro web framework written in Python.
- **Jinja:** Templating language for Python, used in Flask.
- **HTML:** Used to structure the web content.
- **SQLite:** A database engine used to store user and notes data.

## Usage

1. Sign up for an account or log in to an existing one.
2. Start creating, reading, and deleting notes.

## Future Improvements

This app is a simple project I embarked upon during my summer vacation. It was a wonderful journey of learning Flask and web development. There's plenty of room for enhancements such as adding a feature to edit notes, implementing a better user interface using CSS or JavaScript frameworks, or adding a feature to share notes with other users.

Feel free to fork this repository and add your own features or improvements.

Happy coding!
